		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Jackie is an unemployed, 27-year-old who moved from the celestial fields of Napa Valley to the snow covered tundra that is North Jersey in the middle of one of the harshest of winters. Her bad judgment notwithstanding, Jackieâ€™s passion for anything baked, frosted, iced, frozen, poached, and fried far surmounts her always varying waistband. Although she attended the Culinary Institute of America and received an Associates Degree in Baking and Pastry, her creative desires were not completely appeased solely within the kitchen, so she created this blog as an outlet for artistic culinary outbursts.</p>
