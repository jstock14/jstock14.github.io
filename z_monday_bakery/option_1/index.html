					<p>Mondays dont always have the best reputation. They're the start to a work week, the end of a fun weekend, and back to reality. However, we are working to change your view of Mondays by providing a sweet start to your week. We are Monday Bakery. Started by two crazy gals who decided to pursue their dreams of owning their own business. Virginia (aka Peanut) is a New Jersey transplant who moved to Napa for the celebrated CIA diploma and ended up staying for the amazing food and a little bit of wine. Sally (aka Sal Pal) is a Seattle girl who moved down for the CIA training as well, and decided to leave the rain behind for the sunshine. Together they worked at Thomas Keller's celebrated restaurant, Ad Hoc, before taking the plunge to start Monday Bakery.
					</p>
					<p>At the moment, Monday Bakery does not have a brick and mortar location, so please come find us at the following locations:
					</p>	
					<ul>
						<li>V. Sattui Winery: 
								Daily</li>
						<li>Calistoga Farmers Market:
							Saturdays 9-1</li>
						<li>Oakville Grocery:
							Daily 6:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m.</li>
						<li>Ohm Coffee Truck:
							Daily, check our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mondaybakerynapa/">Facebook</a> for times and locations.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>This is our passion. We are so excited to bring the community baked goods that not only taste amazing, but are baked with skill and care. We love trying out new flavors and ingredients, and hope that you will come by</p>
